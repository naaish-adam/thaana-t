## Thaana T Bot

Source code for `@thaana_t_bot` used to transliterate Latin to Thaana. Repo includes bot (server) code and transliteration script.

### Todo/Issues:

- [x] Inline bot
- [ ] Webhook initialization
- [ ] Refactor command extraction
- [x] A consonant after "h" messes up sukun (if a vowel before "h")
- [x] Issues with words like "AI" in dhivehi "eyai"
- [x] Issues with y and yaa, "kiyaa ulheny" etc
- [ ] "Feneyey" is a hard word
- [ ] Support "y" at the end as "ee"? (conflicts the above)
- [ ] How to deal with husnoonu? (example: rangalhu vs rangandu)
- [ ] Sheenu vs shaviyani?
- [ ] Add comments + cleanup
